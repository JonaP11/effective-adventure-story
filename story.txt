$Once upon a time, there was a traveler without a name. 
We join this traveler's story somwhere in Europe where he got a lead that his parents might be there.
In search of his name, this traveler is desperate for any kinds of clues.
Having come from a search from Egypt, the traveler is hungry and dehydrated.
Before he starts his adventure in Europe, he decides to make base somewhere in Italy.

Arriving in Venice, the traveller began his search. It was of great importance that he find a lead before
the Venician police discover his presence. Miraculously, almost conveniently, a strange figure beckons from
a nearby cafe, gently waving their hand and making no noise. The traveller, parched from his journey from Egypt, 
slowly approaches the cafe. The mysterious stranger remained motionless and silent as he approached, merely glaring
from their large, hooded shroud. Suddenly, when the traveller was within an arm's reach, the figure hisses in a shrill, 
raspy voice "I know why you're here, and I have a proposal for you."

This travler finnaly found a nice palce in Italy and rest there. When he walk on the street in Italy, he found a homeless dog. He named this dog "GouGou". This dog is very nice and very quiet. They became good friends.
